## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to tackle a real-world data problem posed in a datathon challenge. Team Crew4 focused on:
- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning:** Preparing raw datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends and patterns in the data.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Visualizing and interpreting spatial data to uncover regional insights.
- **Market Insights & Recommendations:** Generating actionable strategies based on market trends identified in the analysis.

This repository hosts all notebooks, scripts, and documentation detailing our approach and results.

## Methodology
Our approach can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   - Transformed and normalized data for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generated visualizations to summarize the data.
   - Identified initial patterns and correlations.

3. **Geospatial Analysis:**
   - Utilized geospatial libraries (e.g., Folium) to visualize the housing market in the train data.
   - Developed climate analysis to tackle flood and fire issues in Iowa state.

4. **Market Insights & Recommendations:**
   - Conducted statistical analysis to calculate future prediction of house prices.
   - Developed a system to provide users with suitable housing options in the Ames, Iowa area based on certain input features.
   - Provided statistical plots analysing the best time for investment in a year.
   - Developed rental analysis to predict the rental prices based on real estate norms.
